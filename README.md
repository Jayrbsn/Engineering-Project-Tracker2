# Engineering-Project-Tracker2
Next iteration of the project tracker program as required by the HyperionDev Bootcamp

## Project Details

### Description:
For this project I was instructed to create a project management system for a small structural engineering firm called “Poised”. Poised does the engineering needed to ensure the structural integrity of various buildings. I was to create a Java program that they could use to keep track of the many projects on which they work.

### Functionality:
This program an updated version of the Engineering-Project-Tracker also saved in my repository. The program allows users to view details regarding all ongoing projects or create a new project by prompting them to enter the relevant details needed to keep track of said project. The creating of the project calls the createProject method from the Projects class into the main Menu class to create the project object.

The user also has the option to change some details about an existing project such as the due date, the total amount of fees paid so far by the client, and whether the project has been finalised or not. These functions are executed by calling various methods from the Projects class. This program has been upgraded to use an SQL database instead of reading from a txt tile

### Usefulness:
This project could be used as an efficient program for a small company to use as a project management system. It is simple and straightforward to use and the code itself is clean and well commented on, making it easy to understand

### Contributors:
This was a solo project as a requirement for the Hyperion bootcamp. However, the mentors from Hyperion Development have reviewed and overseen all of my work

### Project Status:
There will likely be no more updates on this project as the bootcamp is moving on from databases and into machine learning
